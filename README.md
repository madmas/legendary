# legendary

While there is an inordinate amount of wonderful content to be consumed on the internet (my addiction is HackerNews), every once in a while I get to read a legendary post that simply allows me to level up as a person. 

This is a curated list of such articles (soft limit 100):

- [What is functional programming all about](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/WhatsFunctionalProgrammingAllAbout.html), The core of Functional Programming is thinking about data-flow rather than control-flow
- [Web design in 4 minutes](http://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/), A very very basic css styling walkthrough!
- [React 16 migration engineering](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1716776591680069/react-16-a-look-inside-an-api-compatible-rewrite-of-our-frontend-ui-library/), brilliant take on migration engineering, illustrates the use of:
  - feature toggles to reduce merge conflicts
  - TDD for api coverage
  - regression logging for faster feedback loop
  - coverage chart for motivation
  - staggered rollout and A/B testing with an eye on product metrics for
migration issues
