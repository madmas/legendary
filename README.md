While there is an inordinate amount of wonderful content to be consumed on the internet (my addiction is HackerNews), every once in a while I get to read a legendary post that simply allows me to level up as a person. 

This is a curated list of such articles (soft limit 100):

- [What is functional programming all about](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/WhatsFunctionalProgrammingAllAbout.html), The core of Functional Programming is thinking about data-flow rather than control-flow
- [Web design in 4 minutes](http://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/), A very very basic css styling walkthrough!
- [React 16 migration engineering](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1716776591680069/react-16-a-look-inside-an-api-compatible-rewrite-of-our-frontend-ui-library/), brilliant take on migration engineering, illustrates the use of:
  - feature toggles to reduce merge conflicts
  - TDD for api coverage
  - regression logging for faster feedback loop
  - coverage chart for motivation
  - staggered rollout and A/B testing with an eye on product metrics for migration issues
- [Things you should never do - Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/), Never re-write anything from "scratch", code does not rust, you will be thowing away a lot domain knowledge and bug fixes - try to incrementally refactor the codebase
- [Strategy Letter V - Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/), Micro economics 101, try to commoditize your products complement so that the demand for your product goes up:
  - Microsoft makes a free browser so that more people by it's operating system, 
  - Google makes software so that more people rely on it to feed it information which it can use for better search results which leads to them getting the lions share of advertising money (this example was added by me)
  - Note that it is easier for software to commoditize hardware than the other way around

The following is snippets of useful information (condensed from articles similar to the above which didn't make the cut):

- Wealth is not finite - creation of wealth is independent of the money supply. If you make a gift for someone using stones arranged in the shape of a heart, you have created something desirable and hence you are the more wealthier for it.
- "A good scientist, in other words, does not merely ignore conventional wisdom, but makes a special effort to break it. Scientists go looking for trouble. This should be the m.o. of any scholar, but scientists seem much more willing to look under rocks." - Paul Graham
